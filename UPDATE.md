# MEDISENS Project Update

## 2026-07-03 Authenticated Priority 7 Browser QA Rerun

- Read `FIGMA_UI_REFINEMENT.md` and `TEST_ACCOUNTS.md`, then reran Priority 7 as authenticated browser/workflow QA using the documented role accounts.
- QA method:
  - started the local Vite app at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
  - installed/used Playwright Chromium for browser automation
  - logged in independently per role in isolated browser contexts
  - verified sidebar module visibility, role-scoped buttons, Doctor-only Consult behavior, Register Patient exposure, Nurse action labels, Laboratory drawer behavior, and non-destructive workflow navigation
- Pass/fail by role:
  - Admin: PASS
    - login succeeded as `admin@medisens.com`
    - only User Management appeared in the sidebar
    - no Register Patient or Doctor Consult action appeared
  - BHW: PASS
    - login succeeded as `bhw@medisens.com`
    - sidebar showed Home, Patient Records, New Record, and OCR Generation only
    - BHW label correctly displayed Patient Records, not Records
    - Register Patient appeared in the allowed BHW registration flow
    - Patient Details did not expose the Doctor-only Consult button
    - New Record and OCR/FHSIS report navigation loaded without destructive actions
  - Nurse: PASS
    - login succeeded as `nurse@medisens.com`
    - sidebar showed Home, Patient Records, New Record, and Initial Consultation only
    - dashboard row action displayed Initial Intake, not Consult
    - Patient Records opened Patient Details without a Doctor-only Consult button
    - Initial Consultation navigation loaded successfully
  - Doctor: PASS
    - login succeeded as `doctor@medisens.com`
    - sidebar showed Dashboard, Patient Records, and Consultation Room only
    - Patient Records opened Patient Details first and did not auto-redirect
    - Doctor-only Consult button appeared inside Patient Details
    - clicking Consult transitioned to the Consultation Room context for that patient
    - Register Patient did not appear
  - Laboratory: PASS
    - login succeeded as `labaratory@medisense.com`
    - sidebar showed Dashboard only
    - clicking a lab request row opened the laboratory details as a fixed right-side drawer
    - drawer width measured about 672px on a 1440px desktop viewport
    - backdrop element was present as `.lab-drawer-backdrop` with dim/blur styling and backdrop click closed the drawer
    - no Register Patient or Doctor Consult action appeared
  - Pharmacist: FAIL / BLOCKED
    - login failed using the documented `pharmacists@medisens.com` account with message: Invalid email or password
    - per `TEST_ACCOUNTS.md`, no replacement account was created or substituted
    - Pharmacist module access, patient preview width, and dispensing workflow could not be authenticated in-browser
  - Midwife: PASS
    - login succeeded as `midwives@medisens.com`
    - sidebar showed Home, Patient Records, Census Entry, and OCR Reports only
    - Patient Records and OCR Reports labels were consistent
    - Census Entry and OCR Reports navigation loaded successfully
    - Patient Details did not expose the Doctor-only Consult button
- Confirmed safe UI/access issues:
  - no new code changes were required during this rerun
  - the previous Nurse `Initial Intake` label and Midwife Patient Details label fixes remained effective under authenticated browser QA
- Remaining blocker:
  - Pharmacist account in `TEST_ACCOUNTS.md` does not authenticate, so Pharmacist-specific preview width and workflow QA remain blocked until the documented test account is corrected
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 445 modules transformed, built in 6.47s)

## 2026-07-03 Figma UI Refinement Priority 7

- Read `FIGMA_UI_REFINEMENT.md` and implemented Priority 7 only, focused on role-access QA, UI/accessibility QA, and build verification.
- Preserved all workflows, route behavior, role permissions, Supabase integration, database schema, authentication flow, patient workflows, consultation workflows, laboratory workflows, pharmacy workflows, and business logic.
- Role-access QA performed:
  - confirmed role shells still use explicit role gates: Admin `requireRole('admin')`, BHW `requireRole('BHW')`, Nurse `requireRole('nurse')`, Doctor `requireRole('doctor')`, Laboratory `requireRole('labaratory')`, Pharmacist `requireRole('pharmacist')`, and Midwife `requireRole('midwives')`
  - confirmed Admin sidebar is limited to User Management
  - confirmed BHW sidebar includes Home, Patient Records, New Record, and OCR Generation, with the displayed Records label already using Patient Records
  - confirmed Nurse sidebar includes Home, Patient Records, New Record, and Initial Consultation
  - confirmed Doctor sidebar includes Dashboard, Patient Records, and Consultation Room, without New Record exposure
  - confirmed Laboratory sidebar is limited to its laboratory dashboard/work queue
  - confirmed Pharmacist sidebar is limited to Pending Queue
  - confirmed Midwife sidebar includes Home, Patient Records, Census Entry, and OCR Reports
  - confirmed shared Patient Details `Consult` action is only rendered when the Doctor page passes `onConsult`; BHW, Nurse, and Midwife patient detail modals do not pass that action
  - confirmed Doctor Patient Records still opens Patient Details first, then navigates to Consultation Room only when the Doctor clicks Consult
  - confirmed Register Patient remains visible only in BHW/Nurse-style registration flows already allowed by their role navigation, and not in Doctor, Laboratory, Pharmacist, or Admin shells
- Safe UI/access fixes made during QA:
  - renamed the Nurse dashboard row action from `Consult` to `Initial Intake` so non-doctor UI no longer presents a doctor-only Consult label
  - aligned Midwife Patient Details sidebar labels with the main Midwife shell: Patient Records and OCR Reports
- UI/accessibility QA notes:
  - fetched and applied the web interface guideline checklist for focused static checks around role navigation, labels, icon buttons, dialogs, and focus-visible patterns
  - verified sidebar controls use buttons for actions, active states use `aria-current`, modal dialogs expose dialog semantics, and the shared Doctor-only Consult affordance is scoped by prop ownership
  - authenticated live browser QA could not be completed because no `TEST_ACCOUNTS.md` file or usable test credentials were found in the workspace scan, and no Supabase env values were visible in the current shell
- Files changed:
  - `src/app/nurse/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/patients/details.tsx`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/UPDATE.md`
- Remaining recommendations:
  - run authenticated role-by-role browser QA with seeded test accounts across desktop, tablet, and mobile once credentials are available
  - verify live Supabase-backed data density, empty states, drawer/modal behavior, and no horizontal scrolling under realistic production-sized records
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 445 modules transformed, built in 4.37s)

## 2026-07-03 Figma UI Refinement Priority 6

- Read `FIGMA_UI_REFINEMENT.md` and implemented Priority 6 only, focused on shared component consistency and visual polish.
- Preserved all existing workflows, role permissions, role-based navigation, routes, Supabase integration, database schema, authentication flow, patient workflows, consultation workflows, laboratory workflows, pharmacy workflows, and business logic.
- Component consistency improvements:
  - standardized shared `Button`, `Badge`, `LoadingState`, `EmptyState`, `PageHeader`, `UserMenu`, and `NetworkBadge` styling toward one restrained clinical component language
  - tightened the common dashboard CSS layer for buttons, badges, empty/loading states, dialogs, rounded corners, shadows, hover transforms, and table worklist styling
  - aligned clinical table badges, toolbar backgrounds, action typography, and table header/link weights across Patient Records and role worklists
  - flattened older form-heavy surfaces in Midwife, Patient Registration, Patient Details edit, Follow-Up Visitation, Initial Consultation, and Consultation Room to use consistent borders, 6-8px radii, semibold labels, and subdued shadows
  - removed visible decorative/question-mark navigation artifacts from Consultation Room step controls and cleaned malformed Initial Consultation legend/diagnosis labels
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/Badge.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/LoadingState.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/EmptyState.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/PageHeader.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/UserMenu.tsx`
  - `src/components/shared/NetworkBadge.tsx`
  - `src/styles/dashboard.css`
  - `src/app/midwife/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/patients/templates.tsx`
  - `src/app/patients/details.tsx`
  - `src/app/follow-up-visitation/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/initial-consultation/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/consultation/index.tsx`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/UPDATE.md`
- Remaining recommendations:
  - authenticated role-by-role browser QA is still required to confirm live visual consistency across real data, modals, tables, toasts, and responsive breakpoints
  - a later cleanup pass can migrate remaining page-local buttons/forms to shared primitives where doing so is safe and low risk
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 445 modules transformed, built in 5.47s)

## 2026-07-03 Figma UI Refinement Priority 5

- Read `FIGMA_UI_REFINEMENT.md` and implemented Priority 5 only, focused on responsive PWA viewport usage, whitespace reduction, fixed-width cleanup, and layout density.
- Preserved all existing functionality, routes, role permissions, Supabase integration, database schema, authentication flow, patient workflows, consultation workflows, reporting behavior, and business logic.
- Responsive PWA improvements:
  - added shared viewport/density utilities for fluid page padding, dense clinical panels, flexible form grids, readable content width, and min-width overflow safeguards
  - tightened global mobile spacing for oversized `p-6`, `p-8`, `gap-6`, and `gap-8` surfaces to reduce whitespace on tablet/mobile
  - normalized root/main containers to avoid width traps, `w-screen` overflow, and large blank right-side areas
  - reduced BHW module shells from floating `w-auto` cards to full-width dense panels
  - fixed Midwife main shell from `w-screen` to a viewport-safe full-width layout and reduced page padding
  - tightened Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Laboratory, and Pharmacist page padding/margins around dashboards and worklists
  - flattened older glass/oversized Initial Consultation, Patient Registration, Patient Details page, and Follow-Up Visitation form shells into denser clinical panels
  - expanded Laboratory search width responsively while keeping table scroll contained inside the worklist panel
- Files changed:
  - `src/styles/dashboard.css`
  - `src/app/admin/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/bhw/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/doctor/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/nurse/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/laboratory/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/pharmacist/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/midwife/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/consultation/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/initial-consultation/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/follow-up-visitation/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/patients/details.tsx`
  - `src/app/patients/templates.tsx`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/UPDATE.md`
- Remaining recommendations:
  - authenticated visual QA across desktop, tablet, and mobile role sessions is still required to confirm real data density and no horizontal scrolling under live routes
  - report/PDF preview surfaces still intentionally keep print-sized widths and should be handled separately if the print preview experience needs redesign
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 445 modules transformed, built in 3.43s)

## 2026-07-03 Figma UI Refinement Priority 4

- Read `FIGMA_UI_REFINEMENT.md` and implemented Priority 4 only, focused on refining shared Patient Details into a clinical chart.
- Preserved existing patient-detail behavior, Doctor-only Consult action, Edit Profile flow, vaccine add/remove flow, transaction history loading, role permissions, routes, Supabase integration, database schema, authentication flow, and business logic.
- Patient Details / clinical chart improvements:
  - widened the shared Patient Details modal into a readable clinical chart surface instead of a narrow stacked profile card
  - kept patient identity visible in a denser chart header with existing Consult, Edit Profile, Cancel, and Close actions
  - added shared chart utilities for chart modal sizing, header, body, section panels, field values, summary rows, and sticky save footer
  - restyled Demographics, Coverage & Patient Category, Vaccinations, Emergency Contact, and Encounters / Transaction Timeline as clinical chart sections
  - kept existing transaction history behavior behind the same button action while relabeling it as Encounters & Transaction Timeline
  - improved responsive behavior through a larger desktop max width, internal scrolling, and mobile-friendly viewport constraints
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/patient/PatientDetailModal.tsx`
  - `src/styles/dashboard.css`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/UPDATE.md`
- Remaining recommendations:
  - PatientTransactionHistory card internals still have their own timeline/card styling and can be further densified in a later component-consistency pass
  - authenticated visual QA across Doctor, Nurse, BHW, and Midwife patient-detail entry points is still required
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 445 modules transformed, built in 3.24s)

## 2026-07-03 Figma UI Refinement Priority 3

- Read `FIGMA_UI_REFINEMENT.md` and implemented Priority 3 only, focused on dashboard refinement into RHU operational work queues.
- Preserved role permissions, approved workflows, routes, Supabase integration, database schema, authentication flow, and business logic.
- Used existing dashboard data only:
  - Doctor uses existing waiting queue, follow-ups, visits-today, and total-patient counts
  - Nurse uses existing consented-patient and registry counts
  - BHW uses existing recent-patient, patient-stat, and FHSIS record counts
  - Midwife uses existing patients and census records
  - Laboratory uses existing lab request counts and filtered request worklist
  - Pharmacist uses existing pending prescription and filtered prescription worklist
  - Admin uses existing user and role arrays
- Responsive operational dashboard improvements:
  - added shared RHU work-queue utilities for summary cards, panels, row lists, queue badges, empty states, and action text
  - moved Nurse, BHW, Laboratory, Pharmacist, Admin, Doctor, and Midwife dashboards toward compact work-queue summaries instead of generic dashboard cards
  - kept clinical tables and row-click actions intact while strengthening the surrounding operational context
  - maintained responsive grid behavior without adding page-level horizontal overflow
- Files changed:
  - `src/styles/dashboard.css`
  - `src/app/admin/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/bhw/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/doctor/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/nurse/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/laboratory/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/pharmacist/index.tsx`
  - `src/features/midwife/dashboard.tsx`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/UPDATE.md`
- Remaining recommendations:
  - Doctor pending lab results were not added because the current dashboard does not already load that dataset
  - Pharmacy dispensed/partial-dispense operational sections were not added because the current queue data only exposes pending prescription review in this page
  - authenticated visual QA across every role is still required to validate real production data density and responsive behavior
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 445 modules transformed, built in 3.24s)

## 2026-07-03 Figma UI Refinement Priority 2

- Read `FIGMA_UI_REFINEMENT.md` and implemented Priority 2 only, focused on Patient Records and clinical table/worklist presentation.
- Preserved role access, approved workflows, routes, Supabase integration, database schema, authentication flow, patient-click behavior, and business logic.
- Patient Records improvements:
  - converted the shared `RecordsComponent` from card-grid records into a full-width clinical registry table
  - kept the existing Supabase patient query, name search, barangay filtering, clear-filter behavior, empty/loading states, and row click behavior
  - preserved Doctor Patient Records behavior because Doctor still passes `onPatientClick`, so records open Patient Details first and the Doctor-only `Consult` action remains the explicit route to Consultation Room
  - improved Patient Records column hierarchy for patient identity, age/sex, barangay, classification, contact, and action
  - added a compact filter toolbar and result count consistent with the Figma-inspired patient registry direction
- Clinical table system improvements:
  - added shared clinical table utilities for panels, title bars, toolbars, search controls, filters, badges, scroll containers, row states, and link actions
  - applied the shared clinical table shell to the active Nurse intake table, Laboratory request queue, Pharmacist prescription queue, and Pharmacist medication table
  - reduced decorative card/list treatment in the main pharmacy queue by replacing list rows with a table worklist while preserving prescription selection behavior
  - kept table responsiveness through horizontal table scroll containers instead of page-level horizontal overflow
- Files changed:
  - `src/app/patients/records.tsx`
  - `src/styles/dashboard.css`
  - `src/app/nurse/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/laboratory/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/pharmacist/index.tsx`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/UPDATE.md`
- Remaining recommendations:
  - Midwife FHSIS patient records still use a specialized list with separate History actions and should be converted carefully in a later pass because the file contains older encoded text and workflow-specific history behavior
  - Admin users remain a responsive grid/list hybrid and should be moved to a true table in a later component-standardization pass
  - Reports/PDF tables were not restyled because they are print/report artifacts, not live clinical worklists
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 445 modules transformed, built in 3.14s)

## 2026-07-03 Figma UI Refinement Priority 1

- Read `FIGMA_UI_REFINEMENT.md` and implemented Priority 1 only, using the Figma screenshots as visual inspiration rather than a 1:1 copy.
- Preserved MEDISENS role permissions, role-specific navigation visibility, workflows, routes, Supabase logic, database schema, authentication flow, and business logic.
- Priority 1 improvements completed:
  - refined the shared `Sidebar` into a denser RHU information-system navigation surface with stronger active states, compact MEDISENS branding, clearer section labeling, and restrained dark clinical contrast
  - refined the shared `Topbar` alignment with flatter enterprise styling, compact mobile/desktop system status behavior, and cleaner user/status grouping
  - added a reusable `PageHeader` pattern for consistent page title, subtitle, metadata, and future action placement
  - applied the shared page header to Admin, BHW, Nurse, Doctor, Laboratory, and Pharmacist dashboard/work-queue headers where changes were presentational only
  - kept BHW navigation label as `Patient Records`
  - kept Doctor Patient Records behavior intact: patient details open first and Doctor-only `Consult` action remains the explicit path to Consultation Room
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/Topbar.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/PageHeader.tsx`
  - `src/app/admin/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/bhw/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/doctor/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/nurse/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/laboratory/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/pharmacist/index.tsx`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/UPDATE.md`
- Remaining recommendations:
  - Priority 2 should handle Patient Records/table refinement; table internals were intentionally not redesigned in this pass
  - Priority 3 should handle deeper operational dashboard composition; existing dashboard data/workflows were preserved
  - authenticated visual QA across all MEDISENS roles is still required to confirm the Figma-inspired shell under real role sessions
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 445 modules transformed, built in 3.28s)

## 2026-07-02 Priority 3 Polish, Accessibility, And Responsive QA

- Read `REFACTORING.md` and implemented Priority 3 only.
- Preserved RHU functionality, approved workflows, role permissions, Supabase integration, database schema, authentication flow, realtime behavior, and business logic.
- Issues found:
  - shared modal panels had dialog semantics but did not consistently receive focus on open
  - role modals/drawers did not share Escape-key close behavior even when a visible close/backdrop action already existed
  - toast icons were announced as content even though they are decorative status reinforcement
  - dense clinical tables and dialogs needed stronger viewport constraints for small screens and browser zoom
  - touch targets lacked a shared mobile interaction guard
  - clinical numeric table data needed consistent tabular-number rendering for faster scanning
- Improvements completed:
  - upgraded the shared `Modal` primitive with focus-on-open and optional Escape-key close support
  - wired safe close behavior through Laboratory, Pharmacist, Doctor, and patient-detail modal usages
  - kept modal labels tied to existing visible headings through `aria-labelledby`
  - marked decorative toast status icons as hidden from assistive technology
  - added shared touch-action behavior for controls and links
  - strengthened clinical dialog viewport limits for desktop, tablet, mobile, and zoomed layouts
  - preserved full-height drawer behavior for fixed side panels
  - added shared tabular-number rendering for clinical tables and numeric cells
  - retained reduced-motion handling and visible focus-ring behavior aligned with the MEDISENS blue/cyan accent system
- Responsive and accessibility QA:
  - source-level review covered Admin, BHW, Nurse, Doctor, Midwife, Laboratory, Pharmacist, shared topbar/status, shared modal, toast, patient-detail, table, and dashboard surfaces
  - build-level verification covered all routed Vite entry points
  - authenticated browser QA with live test accounts was not performed in this pass, so final production readiness should still include manual role-by-role viewport testing
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/ui/Modal.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx`
  - `src/styles/dashboard.css`
  - `src/app/doctor/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/laboratory/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/pharmacist/index.tsx`
  - `src/components/patient/PatientDetailModal.tsx`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/UPDATE.md`
- Remaining recommendations:
  - run authenticated desktop/tablet/mobile QA for all seven roles using `TEST_ACCOUNTS.md`
  - continue replacing one-off legacy workflow form classes with shared primitives in a future non-Priority-3 pass
  - consider adding automated accessibility checks for modal focus and keyboard interaction
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 443 modules transformed, built in 3.17s)

## 2026-07-02 Priority 2 UI Discipline And Component Consistency

- Read `REFACTORING.md` and implemented Priority 2 only.
- Did not redo Priority 1 except where shared typography, modal, status, and density rules needed to stay consistent with the Priority 1 work-queue surfaces.
- Preserved RHU functionality, approved Use Case Diagram, workflows, role responsibilities, role permissions, Supabase integration, database schema, authentication flow, and business logic.
- Inconsistencies found:
  - heavy `font-black` / `font-extrabold` styling still appeared across shared components, patient history, role pages, and clinical modals
  - tiny uppercase labels and excessive tracking made clinical metadata harder to scan
  - modal/drawer surfaces were still implemented as one-off role-specific panels despite sharing the same dialog semantics
  - shared primitives existed but did not yet expose a reusable modal primitive
  - the shared online/offline badge still used a pill-like status style and heavier label text than the rest of the clinical topbar
  - lab and patient chart labels still used one-off tiny Tailwind class strings instead of a reusable clinical label pattern
- Components standardized:
  - added `src/components/ui/Modal.tsx` as the shared clinical dialog primitive
  - exported `Modal` from `src/components/ui/index.ts`
  - normalized `Button`, `Input`, `CardTitle`, `EmptyState`, `NetworkBadge`, and `Topbar` typography toward `font-semibold` and quieter labels
  - added shared CSS utilities: `.clinical-panel`, `.clinical-panel-header`, `.clinical-field-label`, and `.clinical-dialog`
  - added global typography discipline for over-heavy font weights, excessive tracking, and tiny label utilities
- Pages affected:
  - Laboratory request drawer now uses the shared `Modal` primitive and shared clinical field labels
  - Pharmacist prescription modal now uses the shared `Modal` primitive and quieter medication table typography
  - Doctor follow-up modal now uses the shared `Modal` primitive and quieter heading typography
  - Patient detail modal now uses the shared `Modal` primitive and shared clinical label styling for patient/vaccination fields
  - Shared topbar/status presentation is more consistent across Admin, BHW, Nurse, Doctor, Midwife, Laboratory, and Pharmacist pages through shared component changes
- Files changed:
  - `src/styles/dashboard.css`
  - `src/components/ui/Modal.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/index.ts`
  - `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/Input.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/Card.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/EmptyState.tsx`
  - `src/components/shared/NetworkBadge.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/Topbar.tsx`
  - `src/app/doctor/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/laboratory/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/pharmacist/index.tsx`
  - `src/components/patient/PatientDetailModal.tsx`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/UPDATE.md`
- Remaining duplicated UI patterns:
  - legacy/static workflow pages still contain one-off form and print/report styling
  - consultation and patient registration workflows still contain repeated local input/button/section class constants that should be migrated in a later pass
  - midwife patient records and census-entry surfaces still have local modal/list styling that should be handled under Priority 3 or a dedicated component-reuse pass
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 443 modules transformed, built in 3.11s)

## 2026-07-02 Priority 1 Critical Healthcare UI Refactor

- Read `REFACTORING.md` and implemented Priority 1 only.
- Preserved RHU functionality, approved Use Case Diagram, workflows, role permissions, Supabase integration, database schema, authentication flow, and business logic.
- Issues found:
  - role dashboards still opened with generic metric-card thinking instead of operational RHU work queues
  - BHW, Nurse, Laboratory, Pharmacist, Doctor, Admin, and Midwife surfaces still used decorative dashboard cards, avatar-first rows, large rounded panels, and elevated card styling
  - patient detail opened directly into scattered demographic sections without a clinical chart summary
  - pharmacy and nursing queues used card/list hybrids where compact table/list treatment supports faster healthcare-worker scanning
  - global visual tokens still allowed heavier shadows, larger radii, and hover scale effects that felt less like enterprise HIS software
- Before/after improvements:
  - BHW dashboard now prioritizes recent registrations and registry actions instead of four vanity metric cards
  - Nurse dashboard now prioritizes a consented-patient intake table with compact clinical columns
  - Doctor dashboard now frames the page as a clinical work queue with waiting patients, follow-ups due, visits today, and total patients as quiet operational metadata
  - Laboratory dashboard now makes lab requests the primary work surface and moves counts into the request header
  - Pharmacist dashboard now uses a compact dispensing queue list instead of a single metric card plus oversized prescription cards
  - Admin dashboard now treats users/roles as an operational account-management table with quiet account totals
  - Midwife dashboard now uses quieter operational summary cards and reduced dashboard animation/elevation
  - Patient details now open with a clinical patient summary before demographics, coverage, vaccinations, emergency contact, and encounter timeline
  - Global dashboard styling now uses flatter elevation, 8px large-radius behavior, and suppresses hover scale effects on serious clinical surfaces
- Files changed:
  - `src/styles/dashboard.css`
  - `src/app/admin/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/bhw/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/doctor/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/laboratory/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/nurse/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/pharmacist/index.tsx`
  - `src/components/patient/PatientDetailModal.tsx`
  - `src/features/midwife/dashboard.tsx`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/UPDATE.md`
- Remaining risks:
  - authenticated visual QA across all roles is still required before calling this production-ready
  - Priority 2 should continue component consolidation for tables, forms, modals, and status/badge discipline
  - some older workflow pages still contain page-specific styling that should be handled in later priorities, not Priority 1
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 442 modules transformed, built in 3.04s)

## 2026-07-02 Enterprise Healthcare UI/UX Audit Pass

- Read `TEST_ACCOUNTS.md` from `docs/superpowers/plans/TEST_ACCOUNTS.md` and audited the active Admin, BHW, Midwife, Nurse, Doctor, Laboratory, and Pharmacist role surfaces against enterprise healthcare UI expectations.
- Preserved the approved Use Case Diagram, workflows, business logic, role permissions, Supabase integration, database schema, and functionality.
- Issues found:
  - role dashboards still had duplicated hand-built topbars, causing inconsistent header spacing, user identity placement, mobile menu behavior, and status indicator alignment
  - Doctor and consultation surfaces still displayed separate realtime/live badges that competed with the shared system online/offline status
  - several clinical search inputs relied on placeholder-only naming, reducing accessibility and screen-reader clarity
  - high-impact modals and clinical drawers lacked consistent `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, and labelled-title semantics
  - broad `transition-all` behavior could animate layout properties unnecessarily, which is not ideal for dense clinical workflows
- Fixes applied:
  - consolidated Admin, BHW, Nurse, Doctor, Midwife, Laboratory, and Pharmacist role headers onto the shared `Topbar`/`NetworkBadge` system for consistent `SYSTEM ONLINE` and `SYSTEM OFFLINE` presentation
  - removed separate Doctor/consultation live badge indicators while leaving realtime state and data behavior intact
  - added accessible names to patient/user/lab/prescription search inputs
  - added dialog semantics and labelled titles to admin user dialogs, follow-up dialog, lab request drawer, pharmacy prescription modal, and patient detail modal
  - constrained the global `.transition-all` utility to non-layout visual properties
- Files changed:
  - `src/styles/dashboard.css`
  - `src/app/admin/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/bhw/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/consultation/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/doctor/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/laboratory/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/midwife/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/nurse/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/patients/records.tsx`
  - `src/app/pharmacist/index.tsx`
  - `src/components/patient/PatientDetailModal.tsx`
  - `src/features/midwife/censusEntry.tsx`
  - `src/features/midwife/patientRecords.tsx`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/UPDATE.md`
- Remaining recommendations:
  - run authenticated browser QA with each account in `TEST_ACCOUNTS.md` to visually verify role-specific dashboards, forms, drawers, modals, toasts, and responsive breakpoints
  - perform a keyboard-only pass across registration, consultation, lab, prescription, and patient-record workflows
  - continue migrating repeated clinical search/filter/table patterns into shared primitives as future presentation-only cleanup
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 442 modules transformed, built in 3.10s)

## 2026-07-02 Responsive Layout Refinement Pass

- Re-read `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and kept the work presentation-only.
- Preserved the approved Use Case Diagram, workflows, business logic, role permissions, Supabase integration, database schema, and functionality.
- Responsive layout improvements:
  - converted the shared application shell, root, main content, and page container rules to full-width, min-width-safe PWA layout behavior
  - removed top-level centered page caps from active Admin, BHW, Nurse, Doctor, Laboratory, Follow-up, Patient Details, Initial Consultation, Lab Request, E-Prescription, Midwife census, and Patient Records views
  - tightened shared content gutters with viewport-aware padding so desktop layouts use available horizontal space without becoming cramped on tablet/mobile
  - updated stats, cards, form sections, patient lists, and table wrappers to use flexible auto-fit grids and min-width-safe overflow behavior
  - expanded Patient Records into responsive multi-column record cards on wider screens while keeping single-column mobile usability
  - updated legacy/static registration, records, and lab-request page CSS to remove fixed-width containers and use fluid responsive grids
- Whitespace/layout issues resolved:
  - removed unnecessary whitespace caused by `max-w-7xl`, `max-w-6xl`, `max-w-5xl`, `max-w-4xl`, `max-w-[1400px]`, and static `1000px`/`1100px`/`1200px` page caps
  - eliminated centered floating-card behavior on wide screens for primary app workspaces
  - reduced oversized page padding on large viewports while retaining readable clinical spacing
  - improved table/list containment to avoid page-level horizontal scrolling

- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed (`vite build`, 442 modules transformed, built in 3.18s)

## 2026-07-02 EMR Density and Branding Refinement Pass

- Re-read `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and preserved 100% of the approved Use Case Diagram constraints.
- Scope was presentation-only: no workflows, functionality, business logic, role permissions, Supabase integration, or database schema were changed.
- Used `src/assets/MEDISENS Logo.png` as the branding reference and kept the active palette restrained: neutral EMR surfaces with light blue, cyan, and sky blue reserved for accents, active states, focus states, and primary actions.
- UI refinements:
  - reduced page padding, topbar height, sidebar header height, card padding, empty-state padding, toast padding, button heights, input heights, modal padding, and patient-history spacing to a consistent 8-point density system
  - flattened overly decorative shadows and removed the remaining dashboard-style background gradient from the shared clinical visual layer
  - normalized older border/fill tokens across shared primitives so cards, buttons, inputs, badges, empty states, toasts, sidebar, topbar, and patient record views read as one enterprise EMR system
  - tightened table row vertical padding and common large `space-y-*` gaps without changing page layouts or workflows
  - retained familiar EMR structure and information hierarchy instead of introducing startup-dashboard or template-style decoration
- Files changed:
  - `src/styles/dashboard.css`
  - `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/Topbar.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/UserMenu.tsx`

- Verification:
  - `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` passed
  - targeted old-token scan passed for edited active UI areas; remaining matches are CSS comments for `auto-fit`
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed with 442 modules transformed and no Vite warnings

## 2026-07-02 Restrained Clinical UI Refinement Pass

- Re-read `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and kept the approved Use Case Diagram constraints intact.
- Scope was presentation-only: no workflow, actor responsibility, role permission, Supabase logic, database behavior, or business logic changes.
- UI refinements:
  - shifted the active shell toward neutral clinical surfaces with MEDISENS blue/cyan reserved for accents, active states, focus rings, and primary actions
  - tightened navigation density, sidebar active states, mobile close control, user profile block, and logout modal styling
  - refined patient detail modal hierarchy, section panels, vaccination forms, record cards, empty state, and sticky action area for a calmer healthcare-aligned appearance
  - normalized remaining teal-heavy labels, borders, hover states, and table hover backgrounds to the restrained clinical palette
- Files changed:
  - `src/styles/dashboard.css`
  - `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
  - `src/components/patient/PatientDetailModal.tsx`
- Verification:
  - `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` passed
  - targeted old-token scan passed for the edited UI files
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed with 442 modules transformed and no Vite warnings

## 2026-07-02 Logo-Aligned UI Refinement Pass

- Re-read `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and used `src/assets/MEDISENS Logo.png` as the branding reference.
- Refined the active UI only; no workflow, Supabase, database schema, or role-navigation behavior was changed.
- Palette refinements:
  - shifted the primary system palette from the previous teal layer to the logo-aligned light blue, cyan, sky blue, and soft azure range
  - applied the palette consistently to sidebar branding, active navigation states, topbar text, buttons, inputs, badges, empty states, toast, network status, focus rings, links, borders, and global page accents
  - added the actual MEDISENS logo asset to the active sidebar brand mark
- Density refinements:
  - tightened page padding, topbar height, card padding, card headers, section gaps, grid gaps, button heights, input heights, empty-state padding, toast padding, and modal spacing using 8-point increments
  - kept information hierarchy clinical and compact without changing form fields, tables, or workflows
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/Topbar.tsx`

  - `npm.cmd run build` passed with 442 modules transformed and no Vite warnings

## 2026-07-02 Visible Clinical UI Redesign Pass

- Re-read `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and inspected the active implementation paths that render the role dashboards.
- Finding: the previous redesign looked mostly unchanged because most real pages still used hard-coded Tailwind dashboard classes, custom page headers, local cards/tables/forms, and the old `dashboard.css` palette; the design-system files existed but were not consistently connected to the active role dashboards.
- Active old-styling areas identified:
  - shared `Sidebar`, `Topbar`, `UserMenu`, `NetworkBadge`, breadcrumbs, UI primitives, and patient detail modal
  - role dashboards with custom headers/cards/tables in Doctor, Admin, BHW, Nurse, Midwife, Laboratory, and Pharmacist pages
  - patient records/forms that still use local Tailwind class constants
- Visible redesign applied:
  - imported the clinical stylesheet through the active `Sidebar` so role dashboards receive the shared visual layer
  - replaced the old blue/slate generic dashboard palette with a MEDISENS clinical teal, soft green-gray surfaces, clearer borders, and calmer shadows
  - redesigned the active `Sidebar` branding to `MEDISENS` with clinical navigation states
  - redesigned shared `Topbar`, `UserMenu`, `NetworkBadge`, `Card`, `Button`, `Input`, `Badge`, `EmptyState`, and `Toast` styling
  - added global clinical selectors for existing active Tailwind page markup so cards, tables, forms, headers, buttons, and badges visibly shift without workflow or database changes
  - redesigned `PatientDetailModal` with clinical modal framing, wider patient-record layout, calmer section panels, teal focus states, and professional action buttons
- Preserved workflows, Supabase logic, role guards, and database schema.
- Verification:
  - `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` passed
  - source scan found no emoji glyphs or `console.log` in `src/` / `pages/`
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed with 441 modules transformed and no Vite warnings

## 2026-07-02 Technical Debt Cleanup Pass

- Audited duplicate components, compatibility wrappers, CSS, hooks, Supabase query usage, debug logging, TODO/FIXME markers, dead exports/types, repeated constants, and naming consistency.
- Safe refactors completed:
  - removed client-side realtime/debug `console.log` calls from Doctor, Consultation, Nurse, and network sync code
  - kept `console.error` / `console.warn` handling and Supabase function logging intact for operational visibility
  - collapsed duplicate laboratory request date formatting into one shared file-level helper
  - removed stale placeholder comments in `useNetworkSync`
- Left compatibility wrappers in place because active pages still import them.
- Left Supabase query structure unchanged to avoid database behavior changes.
- Verification:
  - `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` passed
  - runtime `src/`, `pages/`, `supabase/`, and reminder script scan found no TODO/FIXME markers
  - `src/` scan found no remaining `console.log` calls
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed with 441 modules transformed and no Vite warnings

## 2026-07-02 Safe Cleanup Deletion Pass

- Implemented only the cleanup audit items classified as safe to delete.
- Files deleted:
  - `src/styles/template.css`
  - `supabase/.temp/cli-latest`
  - `supabase/.temp/gotrue-version`
  - `supabase/.temp/linked-project.json`
  - `supabase/.temp/pooler-url`
  - `supabase/.temp/postgres-version`
  - `supabase/.temp/project-ref`
  - `supabase/.temp/rest-version`
  - `supabase/.temp/storage-migration`
  - `supabase/.temp/storage-version`
- Generated output removed locally:
  - `dist/`
- Empty folders removed:
  - `src/components/forms/`
  - `src/components/modals/`
  - `src/features/consent/`
  - `src/features/reports/`
  - `src/features/users/`
  - `src/lib/realtime/`
  - `src/lib/validation/`
- `.gitignore` changes:
  - added `supabase/.temp/` so Supabase CLI local state is not committed again
- Build result:
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed with 441 modules transformed and no Vite warnings

## 2026-07-02 Repository Audit & Hardening Pass

- Audited the repository against `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and checked TypeScript strictness, error handling, role guards, Supabase usage, accessibility patterns, reusable components, duplication, dependency security, dead code, TODO markers, and build output.
- Added `typescript` as a dev dependency so the existing strict `tsconfig.json` can actually be verified with `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit`.
- Fixed strict TypeScript blockers:
  - removed unused React default imports under the React JSX runtime
  - removed unused registration lookup/session state from `TemplatesComponent`
  - removed unused consultation vitals/ref state
  - fixed `OfflineRecord` typing so offline consultation and registration payloads are accepted safely
  - changed shared icon path typing from the global `JSX.Element` namespace to `ReactNode`
- Completed the frontend optimization cleanup started in the prior pass:
  - lazy-loaded Doctor, Nurse, and BHW non-default tab screens
  - lazy-loaded Doctor dashboard Chart.js rendering
  - lazy-loaded PatientDetailModal where it is only opened on demand
  - memoized BHW and Nurse derived patient stats/lists
  - removed unused `Select`, `Modal`, and `ErrorState` UI files and barrel exports
- Fixed security/dependency issues:
  - ran `npm.cmd audit fix`
  - upgraded the affected dependency graph, including Vite from `6.4.2` to `6.4.3`
  - `npm.cmd audit --audit-level=low` now reports zero vulnerabilities
  - changed `send_follow_up_reminder.js` to read service-role and SMS secrets from server-only env names, not `VITE_`-prefixed client-exposed names
- Verified role guard coverage for active page entry modules remains in place through `requireRole` / `requireAnyRole`; shared components and reusable workflow modules remain guarded by their parent role pages.
- Verification:
  - `npm.cmd ls --depth=0` shows one React version and no duplicated direct dependencies
  - `npm.cmd audit --audit-level=low` passed with zero vulnerabilities
  - `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` passed
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed with 441 modules transformed and no Vite warnings
  - `git diff --check -- .` passed with Windows line-ending notices only

## 2026-06-30 UI/UX Audit Cleanup

- Read `docs/superpowers/plans/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and audited the redesigned UI against the design-system goals for shared tokens, reusable components, consistent typography/color/spacing, navigation consistency, emoji removal, accessibility, and responsive behavior.
- Reworked `src/app/patients/patient-consent.tsx` to remove its duplicate inline style system and direct hover style mutations:
  - now uses shared `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardBody`, `CardTitle`, `Badge`, `Button`, and `Input` primitives
  - keeps existing Supabase save flow, signature capture, validation, and toast feedback
  - replaces the signature emoji hint with the shared SVG `Icon`
  - improves responsive signature/name grids with single-column mobile layout and two-column desktop layout
- Removed remaining rendered emoji/icon glyphs from:
  - `src/app/patients/templates.tsx`
  - `pages/e_prescription.html`
- Cleaned non-rendered emoji markers from comments and console messages so the source-level emoji scan is clean.
- Fixed duplicate/malformed morbidity progress rows in `pages/e_prescription.html` that were left behind after prior emoji replacement.
- Confirmed no native `alert`, `confirm`, or `prompt` usage exists in `src/` or `pages/`.
- Verification:
  - source emoji scan: no emoji glyphs found in `src/` or `pages/`
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed with 444 modules transformed

## 2026-06-30 Design System Completion Pass

- Added the reusable MEDISENS design foundation under `src/design-system/`:
  - `colors.ts`
  - `typography.ts`
  - `spacing.ts`
  - `radius.ts`
  - `shadows.ts`
  - `breakpoints.ts`
  - `motion.ts`
  - `theme.ts`
  - `index.ts`
- Added reusable UI primitives under `src/components/ui/`:
  - `Button`
  - `Input`
  - `Select`
  - `Card`
  - `Badge`
  - `Modal`
  - `Toast`
  - `LoadingState`
  - `EmptyState`
  - `ErrorState`
  - `cn` utility
- Added navigation primitives:
  - `src/components/layout/Topbar.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/Breadcrumbs.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/UserMenu.tsx`
- Updated shared compatibility components so existing pages can keep importing:
  - `src/components/feedback/Toast.tsx`
  - `src/components/shared/LoadingState.tsx`
  - `src/components/shared/EmptyState.tsx`
  - `src/components/shared/StatusBadge.tsx`
- Extended `src/components/shared/Icon.tsx` with `menu` and `chevron-right` for shared navigation.
- Updated `src/app/admin/index.tsx` to use the shared `Topbar` with section labeling, breadcrumbs, user identity, and online status.
- Expanded `src/styles/dashboard.css` with reusable design-system utility classes for:
  - pages and shells
  - cards and panels
  - buttons
  - inputs
  - badges
  - loading and empty states
  - static SVG icon slots
- Rebuilt `src/styles/template.css` on top of `dashboard.css` tokens so legacy template pages use the same typography, surfaces, controls, border radius, shadows, and focus states.
- Updated `pages/e_prescription.html` to remove structural emoji navigation and dashboard icons, replacing them with inline SVG icons and design-system badge/button classes while preserving existing navigation targets and script behavior.
- Preserved existing workflows, Supabase integration, role strings, Vite multi-page routing, and page entry points.
- Verification: `npm.cmd run build` passed with 428 modules transformed.


## 1. Update Summary


- The project was reorganized into a cleaner and more maintainable structure.
- The old scattered `scripts/`, `shared/`, and root `css/` files were replaced with a new `src/` folder structure.
- The app is still a Vite multi-page React app. It was not converted to Next.js, React Router, or a single-page app.
- Role-based dashboards, patient workflows, laboratory, pharmacy, midwife reports, and admin user management were improved and hardened.
- The production build is currently passing with `npm run build`.


## 2. Major Changes Made


- Reorganized the main application code into these main folders:
  - `src/app` for page entry points and dashboards.
  - `src/components` for reusable UI components.
  - `src/features` for workflow-specific modules.
  - `src/lib` for auth, Supabase, realtime, validation, and utility code.
  - `src/hooks` for reusable React hooks.
  - `src/types` for shared TypeScript types.
  - `src/styles` for shared CSS files.
- Updated all HTML page entry points in `pages/` to load files from the new `src/` structure.
- Updated `vite.config.ts` so the production build includes all role pages, including `midwife.html`.
- Added shared services and helpers for important MEDISENS workflows.
- Improved safety around Supabase write actions, role checks, realtime subscriptions, offline behavior, and print/PDF handling.


## 3. Files or Folders Updated


### Initial Structure Update
- Updated:
  - `pages/*.html`
  - `vite.config.ts`
  - `tsconfig.json`
- Added or reorganized under:
  - `src/app/`
  - `src/components/`
  - `src/features/`
  - `src/hooks/`
  - `src/lib/`
  - `src/styles/`
  - `src/types/`
- Removed from the active structure:
  - `scripts/`
  - `shared/`
  - root `css/`

### Panel Revision Sprint (Commit `4c35de7`)
- Added:
  - `src/features/patients/vaccineService.ts`
- Changed:
  - `src/features/patients/history.ts`
  - `src/components/patient/PatientTransactionHistory.tsx`
  - `src/components/patient/PatientDetailModal.tsx`
  - `src/app/patients/details.tsx`
  - `src/app/patients/templates.tsx`
  - `src/app/initial-consultation/index.tsx`
  - `src/app/consultation/index.tsx`
  - `src/features/midwife/patientRecords.tsx`

Important: the removed files were replaced by files inside `src/`. The workflows were not intentionally removed.


## 4. Features Added or Improved


### Initial Features
- Role-based routing and dashboard protection were improved.
- Admin, BHW, Doctor, Nurse, Pharmacist, Laboratory, and Midwife dashboards now use the new structure.
- Patient registration now uses shared validation and shared Supabase workflow logic.
- Patient consent now checks for existing consent before saving a duplicate.
- Nurse initial consultation now saves consultation and vital signs more safely.
- Doctor consultation now supports:
  - consultation saving,
  - follow-up creation,
  - lab request creation,
  - prescription creation,
  - lab result notification.
- Laboratory workflow now supports safer lab result insert/update behavior.
- Pharmacy workflow now handles malformed prescription data more safely.
- Midwife reports now include loading/error handling and better PDF pagination.
- Admin user management now preserves the existing role strings, including `labaratory` and `midwives`.
- Shared UI helpers were added for:
  - toasts,
  - online/offline badges,
  - empty states,
  - loading states,
  - sidebar layout,
  - print iframe cleanup.

### Panel Revision Sprint
- **Vaccine record management**: New `vaccineService.ts` provides CRUD for vaccine records stored in `fhsis_logs.data_fields.vaccine_records` (category `'vaccination'`). Accessible from the PatientDetailModal — any staff role (BHW, nurse, midwife, doctor) can add/remove vaccines while viewing patient details.
- **Unified patient history**: `PatientTransactionHistory` component now queries 9 tables (patients, patient_consent, initial_consultation, consultation, lab_request, lab_result, prescription, follow_up, fhsis_logs) and composes a single newest-first timeline with 10 transaction types.
- **Rich transaction details**: Each transaction type now exposes its full set of medical fields:
  - Registration: demographics, contact, consent status
  - Consent: status, personnel name
  - Initial consultation: chief complaint, diagnosis, time, mode, referred by, transfer
  - Doctor consultation: complaints, assessment, diagnosis, treatment/management/plan, family history, immunization, smoking, drinking, past medical/surgical history
  - Lab request: requested tests (itemized by category), complaint, urgent flag
  - Lab result: findings, performed by, date performed
  - Prescription: medications parsed from JSON (name, dosage, frequency, duration, quantity)
  - Follow-up: complaint, diagnosis, treatment, visit date, status
  - Vaccine: name, dose, date, remarks
- **Transaction history UI**: Redesigned with vertical timeline, colored dots per type, type-specific icons, 2-column item grid, hover effects, loading state, and empty state.
- **Midwife vaccine display**: FHSIS log history modal now shows vaccine records from `data_fields.vaccine_records` using `normalizeVaccineRecords()`.


## 5. Bugs Fixed


### Initial Bug Fixes
- Fixed missing Vite build entry for the Midwife page.
- Fixed role-based access issues across dashboards.
- Fixed admin role creation flow so Admin users can be created using the configured verification PIN.
- Fixed toast layering so success/error messages appear above modals and blurred overlays.
- Fixed Laboratory result saving so it updates existing results when appropriate instead of creating unnecessary duplicates.
- Fixed Laboratory request status updates after results are completed.
- Fixed Doctor notification when lab results are completed.
- Fixed Pharmacy crash risk when prescription JSON is malformed.
- Fixed unavailable medication print layout so long text wraps better.
- Fixed print iframe cleanup to reduce leftover hidden iframes.
- Replaced native alert-style feedback in main workflows with toast notifications where safe.

### Panel Revision Sprint
- **Date inputs now left-aligned**: Registration (`templates.tsx`), nurse triage (`initial-consultation/index.tsx`), and doctor consultation (`consultation/index.tsx`) date/time fields explicitly set `text-left` to override browser default centering.
- **Disabled/read-only field contrast**: Age (registration), BMI, nutritional status, blood type (nurse triage), and BMI (doctor consultation follow-up) now use `bg-slate-100` with `text-slate-500/600` and distinct borders instead of blending into the background.
- **Grey panel readability**: Smoking/drinking history panel and signature panel in doctor consultation changed from flat `bg-slate-50` to `bg-slate-50/70` with `shadow-sm` for better visual depth.
- **Removed redundant detail sections**: `PatientDetailModal` no longer shows separate initial consultation and doctor consultation lists below the timeline — those records are already represented in the unified transaction history.
- **Expanded role access to history**: Patient details page history button now accessible to nurse, doctor, midwife, and BHW (previously nurse-only).


## 6. UI/UX Changes


### Initial UI Changes
- Added more consistent toast feedback across workflows.
- Added shared online/offline badges.
- Added shared empty and loading states.
- Improved table and queue empty states in several dashboards.
- Improved modal/toast layering so messages are readable.
- Improved print slip layout for unavailable medications.
- Preserved the existing MEDISENS visual direction and did not redesign the full system.
- Mobile layouts were improved where safe, especially for dashboards and modals.

### Panel Revision Sprint
- **Timeline view**: Patient transaction history now uses a vertical timeline layout with colored dots (blue for registration, amber for consent, purple for follow-up, green for results, indigo for vaccines) and type-specific emoji icons.
- **Inline vaccination management**: PatientDetailModal shows live vaccine count, add/remove UI with inline form (name, dose, date, remarks), loading spinner, and empty state.
- **Input consistency**: All text inputs across registration, nurse triage, and doctor consultation now use `bg-white` (was `bg-slate-50`) for cleaner appearance with better label contrast.
- **Itemized clinical data**: Chief complaints, diagnosis, medication/treatment, and management/treatment in doctor consultation HistoryPanel now split into individual list items via `itemizeText()` for easier scanning.


## 7. Backend / Database Changes, If Any


- No database schema changes were made.
- No tables were renamed, removed, or recreated.
- No destructive database migration was added.
- Supabase integration was preserved.
- Existing database role strings were preserved:
  - `labaratory`
  - `midwives`
  - `BHW`
- Supabase calls were better organized into shared or feature-level modules where practical.
- Vaccine records are stored in `fhsis_logs.data_fields.vaccine_records` as a JSON array under `category: 'vaccination'` — compatible with the existing schema used by the midwife child logbook.


## 8. Important Notes for the Team


- This is still a Vite multi-page app, not a Next.js app.
- The old `scripts/` folder is no longer the active code location.
- The active application code now lives in `src/`.
- Do not change role strings casually. Some values look misspelled but may already exist in the database.
- `labaratory` is intentionally preserved for compatibility.
- `midwives` is intentionally preserved for compatibility.
- Admin user creation currently uses a frontend verification PIN fallback of `1234`. This is acceptable for a demo, but it is not production-grade security.
- The build passes, but the app still needs real account testing using Supabase demo users.
- Vaccine records stored via `vaccineService.ts` use the `fhsis_logs` table with `category: 'vaccination'` — the same table used by the midwife FHSIS child logbook, but with a separate category to avoid conflicts.
- The `PatientTransactionHistory` component queries all transaction tables in parallel via `safeSelect()` — if a table is missing or an optional column is absent, it fails silently and skips that data.


## 9. Remaining TODOs or Known Issues


- Full offline sync is not complete. Some critical actions are blocked when offline and show a warning toast.
- Patient registration still has limited local offline behavior, but this is not a full offline-first system.
- Several files still contain loose TypeScript types such as `any`. The build passes, but future cleanup should continue improving types.
- `ReportGenerator` creates a large build chunk. This should be code-split later for better performance.
- Supabase Row Level Security policies were not changed or fully audited in this update.
- Admin user creation should eventually move to a secure backend function instead of being handled fully on the frontend.
- Real end-to-end testing with actual demo accounts is still required before presentation.
- `lab_request.is_urgent` column may not exist in all deployed schemas — the lab request transaction type checks for it and only shows "Urgent: Yes" if truthy.
- `patient_consent.personnel_name` may not exist in older schemas — falls back to `consent_personnel` for display.
- Midwife child logbook vaccine row UI (`censusEntry.tsx`) currently saves to `data_fields.vaccine_records` — this should be verified with real FHSIS usage.
- No edit capability for individual vaccine records — only add/remove is supported.
